# first post

I've tried a few times to start a blog. I'm lazy and each attempt has had too much friction, either in publishing or composing. This time I'm trying to compose in my normal note-taking app and publish behind the scenes with no manual intervention. I'll either keep this up with some consistency or I'll know once and for all that the universe does not intend for me to become a steady blogger.
